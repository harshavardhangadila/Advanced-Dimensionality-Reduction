1. Locally Linear Embedding (LLE):
LLE is a manifold learning technique that preserves local neighborhood distances. It is particularly suited for non-linear datasets. The demonstration should highlight LLE's capability to maintain the structure of data, using datasets like face images to show how it handles non-linearity effectively.

2. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):
t-SNE is a popular technique for creating 2D or 3D visualizations of high-dimensional data. Interactive visualizations can be created in Colab to explore its ability to cluster data points effectively. Using datasets like handwritten digits or medical datasets, itâ€™s possible to highlight the clarity of clusters and provide comparisons across dimensions.

3. ISOMAP:
ISOMAP extends MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) to nonlinear data. The demonstration could focus on datasets such as terrain data or 3D to 2D projections to showcase its strength in preserving the global structure of data manifolds.

4. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP):
UMAP is a versatile, fast, and interactive dimensionality reduction tool. Using tools like the UMAP visualization dashboard, it can demonstrate interactive clustering for datasets like genomic sequences or patient data from medical datasets.

5. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS):
MDS transforms data to a lower dimension while preserving distance relationships. It is useful for linear datasets, and the demonstration could compare its effectiveness with ISOMAP on the same datasets to illustrate its limitations with non-linear data.

6. Randomized PCA:
Randomized PCA is a fast approximation of standard PCA. It works efficiently with large datasets like sensor or network data. The demonstration should emphasize its computational efficiency while comparing the variance captured with other PCA techniques.

7. Kernel PCA:
Kernel PCA extends PCA to handle non-linearity using kernels like RBF or polynomial. This is effective for datasets with complex patterns, such as image data, where it captures the intricacies of relationships better than linear PCA.

8. Incremental PCA:
Incremental PCA is ideal for streaming data or datasets too large to fit into memory. The demonstration can show step-wise dimensionality reduction using a large tabular dataset to highlight its ability to process data in chunks.

9. Factor Analysis:
Factor analysis is a statistical technique that models observed variables as linear combinations of potential factors. Using scikit-learn, it can be demonstrated on financial or medical datasets to uncover latent variables.

10. Autoencoders:
Autoencoders are neural networks designed for non-linear dimensionality reduction. Using PyTorch or TensorFlow, the demonstration should apply autoencoders to datasets like MNIST to show reconstruction and latent space representation, contrasting them with traditional techniques.
